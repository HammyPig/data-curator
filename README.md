## What data curator does

Data curator creates organised archives containing files sourced from your folders. At the moment, the program is tailored to the storage of images.

## Usage

```py main.py```

## What to expect

When first ran, you will be asked to input a destination path for your archive. This is the root folder of where everything will be copied to.

Next, you will be asked to paste a source path. The program will find all images stored in this directory (including subfolders), and copy them into the destination path with a formatted filename.

A log will be stored in the archive directory such that all original directories and filenames are recorded.
